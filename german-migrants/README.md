The dataset in this folder is an anonymised version of a dataset from Dr. Felix Krawatzek and Dr. Gwendolyn Sasse deposited here: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4516772

The original dataset concerns letters sent between German migrants and their families in the 19th and 20th Centuries, as published about here https://doi.org/10.1007/s12286-018-0378-9.

Felix and Gwendoyn collaborated with Martin John Hadley to create an interactive visualisation of the dataset as part of the Interactive Data Network (see idn.it.ox.ac.uk). The code for the visualisation is deposited here: doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5336194

The anonymisation process anonymised locations, dates and number of letters sent. It's essentially nothing close to the original dataset. However, it's a useful example of how messy datasets can be and how useful R is for tidying such data.
