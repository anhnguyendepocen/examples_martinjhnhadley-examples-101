# Collated datasets

This repository contains a selection of datasets that are useful for teaching reproducible research and data visualisation methods with R.

Each folder contains a readme.md file containing a complete description of the source of each dataset. Note that there are **not** instructions for working with these datasets!

These datasets are (unless stated explicitly) **not** authored by me (Martin John Hadley) but have been used in a variety of training courses that I've written:
